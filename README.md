This is the repository for the first app of the Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course.
It's called alpha-blog!

Steps to save changes:

git status: Check to see which files have been modified. Also lets you know if your local
branch is ahead of the remote branch by some number of commits.

git add -A: Add all the files that have been modified

git commit -m "insert message here": Commit files

git pull -u origin something something: In the YouTube video they use a 
git pull command with the -u flag before pushing, but they don't do it in the Rails tutorial. Figure out what this command is and what exactly it does later if necessary.

git push: Push to remote repository.
